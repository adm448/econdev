<h1> Internet Access, GDP Growth, and Labor Force Participation </h1>
<h2> 2000-2016 </h2>

<p> We'll examine two datasets. </p>

<ul>
	<li> <b> The International Telecommunications Union </b> provides data on the percentage of each country's population using the internet for every year between 2000 and 2016. <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx"> Data linked here</a></li>
	<li> <b> The World Bank </b> tracks a laundry list of economic indicators for every country in the world, dating back as far as 1960. The two indicators of interest in our study will be labor force participation rate for ages 15+ and GDP per capita in constant 2010 USD. <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators"> Data linked here</a></li>
</ul>

<p> In terms of data visualization, we plan to construct an interactive scatterplot similar to the Gapminder model, which tracks life expectancy, GDP, and population for each country between 1800 and 2008. We will plot GDP per capita on the x-axis and labor force participation on the y-axis. Bubble size will represent the percentage of the population using the internet, and bubble color will represent the region for each country. <a href="http://romsson.github.io/dragit/example/nations.html"> Example linked here</a> </p>
