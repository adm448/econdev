Group A1 Process Log

Note: Our Github repository does not contain many comments, as the vast majority of our meetings were held in person. We also worked together in person, so problem-solving took place live rather than over the web. The notes below document the output and blockers discussed at each meeting.

Retrospective - team 
Continue doing: in person meetings and working sessions were productive and helpful
Start doing: make more explicit, deliberate use of Trello as a tool for tracking progress; update it more frequently. 
Stop doing / areas for improvement: Stop diving into detailed problem-solving without first completing the scrum process


Retrospective - Megan
Continue doing: In-person meetings that were held at a regular pace, but with enough time in between to complete the previously assigned tasks (we agreed to do this after the first meeting)
Start doing: More consistency in updating Trello board / making use of it as a tool to keep track of what teammates are working on
Stop doing:  Holding unstructured meetings - complete the scrum updates before beginning problem solving to ensure that all updates and issues have been surfaced


Retrospective - Corinna
Continue doing: our in person meetings and working sessions - those were very helpful and productive!
Start doing: 
Refer back to and update the Trello more frequently to reflect our improving understanding of our tasks and challenges, as well as to reflect decisions made in the scrum meetings/working sessions. This could have helped us with having a very neat overview of the project at all times. 
For me personally: ask for help from my team mates/ the class / the teaching team earlier. I found myself wrestling for hours with a minor issue that took Ishaan literally one minute to resolve - so if I had to do it again, for the benefit of my output product and my learning experience I would ask questions earlier.
Stop doing / areas for improvement: maybe we could have been better at explaining to each other in more detail during our scrum meetings what we are doing, where we are in the process and what our blockers are. We were a small group so would have had enough time to go into a greater level of detail, which I think would have helped us help each other in a more targeted way. 


Retrospective - Adam 
Continue doing:  The in-person team meetings worked the best, but when we weren’t all able to get together, I felt we collaborated well via slack and github (e.g., resolving a merge conflict).
Start doing:  More closely adhere to the scrum structure by starting each meeting with accomplishments, goals, and blockers.  Also use that time to really talk through how each group member’s page/visualization contributed to the overall project.
Stop doing:  Merging our own commits into the master.  This wasn’t a big deal, since we were mostly working on our own pages, but I think going forward (or if this were a larger project) it’d be good to get in the habit of having a teammate or the product owner review the changes.
