<h1>Corinna's section</h1>
<h2>Internet usage male-female gender gap </h2>

<p>This section will host a map of the world for 2015/16 in which countries are highlighted in different colours depending on the size of the gap in their female to male Internet usage ratio (defined as difference in % points). Countries where women have a smaller Internet usage ratio than men will be shown in shades of orange/red, countries where women have a higher Internet usage ratio will be shown in shades of green, and countries with equal ratios between women and men will be shown in blue. As users hover over a given country, they will be shown total male Internet usage, female Internet usage and the implied % point gap that I am illustrating via the colours.</p>

<p>Having analyzed the data, I am planning to use 9 colour categories (3 shades of green, blue, and 5 shades of organge/red).</p>
