<h1> A1 Class Project - Econ Development</h1>
<h2> Bridging the Digital Divide</h2>

<h3> Corinna Fehst, Adam Murray, Megan White </h3>

<p> In this project we'll be looking at basic indicators of internet connectivity. Our first two analyses (Adam and Megan) will consider how internet connectivity correlates to economic growth, based on the premise that investments in telecommunciations infrastructure will have a positive impact on growth broadly, and innovation specifically. Our third analysis (Corinna) will consider how internet connectivity varies by gender in different regions. </p>
