<h1> Internet Access Worldwide </h1>

<p> We'll examine data from <b>The International Telecommunications Union</b> on fixed broadband subscriptions for nearly all countries from 2000-2016.</p>

<p> In terms of data visualization, a map would great to show internet penetration rates around the world, although showing change over time will be more advanced.  I need to explore other visualizations for comparing two variables in a geographic context. </p>
