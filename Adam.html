<h1> Internet Access and Innnovation </h1>

<p> We'll examine two datasets. </p>

<ul>
	<li> <b> The International Telecommunications Union </b> provides data on fixed broadband subscriptions for nearly all countries from 2000-2016. </li>
	<li> <b> The World Intellectual Property Organization </b> conducts an annual survey of IP activity around the world, including for patents, trademarks, and industrial activity. </li>
</ul>

<p> In terms of data visualization, a map would great to show internet penetration rates around the world, although showing change over time will be more advanced.  I need to explore other visualizations for comparing two variables in a geographic context. </p>
