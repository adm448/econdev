<h3> Motivation</h3>
<br>
<p>Like in so many other areas of life, women do not yet have equal rights to men when it comes to Internet access. Today, <b>women in many countries of the world still face disadvantages in Internet Access compared to their male fellow citizens </b> - sometimes to a significant degree. <br> <br> The interactive map below visualizes this <b>Female Internet Access Gap. </b> It seeks to create transparency and to thereby motivate change.</p>
<br>

<h3> The Female Internet Access Gap - Methodology </h3> <br>
<p>For each country where reliable data is available, the map below displays the percentage point (% pt) difference between male and female Internet access rates, along with the total male and female Internet access rate for the given country. </p>

<p>As such, there are two main outcomes for a country: 
<ul>
	<li><b>Female Internet Access Gap </b>: Countries where women have lower Internet access than men are coloured in a shade of red or orange, depending on the size of the gap</li> <br>
	<li><b>No Female Internet Access Gap</b> Countries where women have equal or higher Internet access than men are highlighted in shades of green, depending on how much larger female access is.</ul><br>

<b>Example</b>: if female Internet penetration in Country X is 50% (meaning 50% of women in Country X have access to the Internet) and male Internet penetration is 60%, then the Female Internet Access Gap is -10 % pts, and Country X will be colored in light red.<p>
