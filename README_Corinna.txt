README: CORINNA FEHST------DATA------The original data for this visualization comes mostly from the latest UN International Telecommunications Union’s Internet Access by Gender Statistics (2016/16) (https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx). This data is available in Excel format, and the original ITU data file is located on our Team A1 GitHub, in the Data > Corinna folder (“Raw ITU data as available online_Corinna.xsl”).However, this ITU data omitted some key countries / geographies, which I decided to manually add from the sources below. - China Internet Network Information Center for China (China’s official government agency for Internet statistics) (https://cnnic.com.cn/IDR/ReportDownloads/201706/P020170608523740585924.pdf)- Pew Research Center for South Africa, Vietnam, Uganda, Tanzania, Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya, India, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Burkina Faso (http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/Internet-access-growing-worldwide-but-remains-higher-in-advanced-economies/)- Argentinian Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Censos (https://www.indec.gov.ar/nivel4_default.asp?id_tema_1=4&id_tema_2=26&id_tema_3=71) - Statista for Canada (https://www.statista.com/statistics/418210/gender-distribution-of-Internet-users-in-canada/)Thereafter, I used an Excel index-matching function to create three letter country codes to link the country names in my file to a json file used by my visalization to define the contours of the map it shows ( “world_countries.json” file in Data>Corinna). My D3 visualization was set up to draw on a .tsv/csv datafile to start with, so I did not have to conduct elaborate file transformations. My final data file, as used by my visualization, is located on the Team A1 GitHub, in the Data > Corinna folder (“Internet_Access_By_Gender”).---------VISUALIZATION---------My visualization consists of 2 separate elements: the Map (http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/8e15870eb432a21f0bc4d3d527b2d14f), and the Legend (http://bl.ocks.org/KoGor/5685876) I made the following adjustments to my Map: - Changed colours to match my data - The map was originally set up to only display one datapoint when users would hover over the map. To make this more interesting, I created two additional variables (‘male’, ’female’), which the D3 now shows too when a mouse hovers over the map.- Data on male/female internet access was not available for many countries in my dataset. I adjusted the D3 to show those countries in grey, and used an if {NaN} check to ensure that, in the event of missing data, the map would say “Data not available” instead of NaN.- Tweaked the colour/bolding of data displayed when the mouse hovers over the mapI made the following adjustments to my Legend: - Made the legend match the colour code of my map (the legend works on a slightly adjusted ‘extended’ threshold model for mapping colours, which made this trickier than expected) - Changed legend colours, position, font ---------BRANCHING---------I created a number of branches to develop different parts of my project page, and deleted these via the GitHub repository (and locally). ---------OTHER---------Please note that my individual sprint 2 reflections are included in the file that contains our team reflections and scrum meeting notes.Thanks for the fun class!
