Class project (A1)

Welcome to our visualization project! To see the final product, please visit https://adm448.github.io/econdev/

The main html files on our website are located in the top folder, along with a README for each visualization describing the process 
of building it and our favicon image.

In the scripts folder, you will find the scripts used to implement each D3 visualization.

In the data folder, you will find the original datasets we used as well as the converted datasets that read into each visualization. 
Additionally, the data folder contains scripts used to convert our data into different formats.

Finally, in the styles folder you will find various CSS stylesheets for the landing page and for each individual visualization webpage.

We hope you enjoy learning about global Internet access!
